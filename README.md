# Speech_To_Text
Recognizes your speech in mp3 audio file, wav file or laptop microphone and converts to text 

To do this mini project, I referred online tutorials and used Google Speech API

#### How to run:

##### You can run with audio .wav as input file 
python final_wav_to_text.py wav_test_1.wav 

or 
##### or without wav input file (Just speak to microphone)
$ python final_wav_to_text.py 

OR 
$python laptop_speech_to_text.py

input as .wav audio file 

output: as text
(Goal feeding the audio file to a speceh recongition system)




#### Convert mp3 speech audio to text ########

Inside the following program, change the input variable "mp3_filename" with your mp3 file name, and on running the program it would converts .mp3 to .wav file (transcript.wav) and then prints the text recognized from mp3 or wav audio files 

Example: mp3_filename = "test_1.mp3"

## how to run
$ python convert_audio_mp3_file_to_text.py
